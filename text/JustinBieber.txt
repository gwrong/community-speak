I need you (the) I need you.
I need you (the) I need you.
I need you, you, you, you, you, you.
I need you (the) I need you.
I need you (the) I need you.
I need you, you, you, you, you, you.
You, you, you.
I need you the most.

I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it.
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can’t deny it.
Now I’m all alone and my joys turned to moping.
Tell me, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need you?
Couldn't find you anywhere.
When you broke down I didn't leave you.
I was by your side.
So where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?

I gave you attention when nobody else was paying.
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?
To keep you warm.
I showed you the game everybody else was playing, that's for sure.
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying, oh Lord.

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?

I need you (the) I need you.
I need you (the) I need you.
I need you, you, you, you, you, you.
Where are you now that I need you?
I need you (the) I need you.
I need you (the) I need you.
I need you, you, you, you, you, you.
I need you the most.

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
I need you the most (I need you the most, I need you the most).

Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love,
There was nobody that compared to my baby.
And nobody came between us or could ever come above.
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck,
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks.
She made my heart pound, it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and.
At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing.
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...

I close my eyes, I take it slow.
Lay on down and let me rest my soul.
I've been so high, I've been so low.
I'm just tryna find my way back home.
Can't help but roam.
My signal's gone.
Guess this journey's left me on my own.
I don't care why I'm alone, alone, alone.

And if I could.
Forget about the way you love me.
Forget about the world, we're set in stone.
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now.
If only I could hit the ground.
I never thought that I'd be broken.
I never thought I'd be this far from home.
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now.
If only I could hit the ground.
If only I could hit the ground.
If only I could hit the ground.

I close my eyes, I take it slow.
Lay on down and let me rest my soul.
I've been so high, I've been so low.
I'm just tryna find my way back home.
Can't help but roam.
My signal's gone.
Guess this journey's left me on my own.
I don't care why I'm alone, alone, alone.

And if I could.
Forget about the way you love me.
Forget about the world, we're set in stone.
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now.

If only I could hit the ground.
If only I could hit the ground.
If only I could hit the ground.

Take it one day at a time.
Reach for the stars now.
Ooh just leave the past behind.
It's a part of living.
It's a part of living.

If only I could hit the ground.
If only I could.
If only I could hit the ground.
I could hit the ground, right now.
If only I could hit the ground.
If I could hit the ground.
Then I'd be falling down.
If only I could hit the ground.
If I could hit the ground.

Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it.
Heart's in it, heart's in it.
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it.
All in it, all in it.

If you got a twenty for all of your tries.
Twenty for all of the times, the times you got back up, woah.
You'd be a billionaire in a year.
That's what you gotta think 'till you're there, on the regular.

If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication.
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah.
Still don't condone it, love is a component.
You're the only opponent, gotta seize the moment.

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it.
Heart's in it, heart's in it.
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it.
All in it, all in it.
Gonna give each time.
Said it won't hurt my side.
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it.
All in it, all in it.

All in it, all in it.

Ever had a good time easy five strings?
A guitar with only one string, I can only play one song, ooh.
A simple melody, simple enough to make the world sing.
Strong enough to make your mood swing, you know what I mean.

If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication.
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah.
Still don't condone it, love is a component.
You're the only opponent, gotta seize the moment.

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it.
Heart's in it, heart's in it.
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it.
All in it, all in it.
Gonna give each time.
Said it won't hurt my side.
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it.
All in it, all in it.

All in it, all in it.

See growing up I...
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything.
Because I, I just didn't think I wasn't good enough.
And maybe if I was good at something, that I'd get recognition from that.
But I quickly found out that, I wasn't going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed.
Because, because people aren't perfect.
And, by not being perfect you, you sometimes can disappoint people.
And with God, it's like He's perfect and He never disappoints.
So I just get my recognition from Him.
And give Him recognition.

Oh oh baby.
Yeah, oh oh.

If I believe in love and you believe in love.
Then we can be in love somehow.
If you want the best for us.
Like I want the best for us.
Then we gotta learn to trust right now.

Don't let this effort go to waste.
Put our all in it.
Don't want to be left with the questions, why.
Let's be honest with ourselves.
Did we really come this far.
Just to watch it go down the drain?

Yeah, sometimes the heart can see what's invisible to the eye.
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings.
They don't ever lie.
Well giving up is immature.
There's so much more to live for.
That I want to see us together now.
Cause we're strong enough to endure, woah.

If I believe in love and you believe in love.
Then we can be in love, somehow.
If you want the best for us.
Like I want the best for us.
Then we got to learn to trust right now.

Growing pains come along with these changes.
Some people get closer some people separate, yeah.
Don't think we should separate.
And we both adore one another.
You're a dream come true.
We should start off brand new.
That's what we ought to do.
Yeah.

Yeah, sometimes the heart can see what's invisible to the eye.
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings.

Hurts but it's necessary.
Don't want us to lose what we are.
Don't want us to lose what we are.
Lose what we are.

If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it.
Believing in that she'll say I'll have you livid.
No, they won't be happy 'til your love is over.
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it

They ain't never had your back like I got it.
They ain't never had trust like how we got it.
So they can't help but to come and hate on it.
They see what we got and you know they want it.
Don't question it

Get the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em.

[Nas:]
She texts me "How's your love life?" and "How are you? ", I said "I'm good"
They only get as close as you allow them to.
We should be closer together, warm oceans, better weather.
Instead of us playing games forever, she says whatever.
I says whatever, who get you wetter than a half moon wearer.
HSTRY sweater, serendipity when you with me.
Swear you love that one thing we did that one time in that one place.
Blew your mind, you got my mind going when I'm home.
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42.
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you.
You and I in that Wraith, retire my pimp super-fly cape.
Just my Mets cap and my badge and I'm straight.

Don't question it.
You ain't gotta question it.
You already know the answer.
The truth don't make us relevant.
Hurts but it's necessary.
Don't want us to lose what we are.
Don't want us to lose what we are.
Lose what we are.

Subjected to my system, reflecting on the days.
When we used to be just friends.
Protected both our interests, our trust was in a bank.
That's where our hearts were safe.
And then we got closer.
Separated from my ex 'til we got closure.
Ooh, on every visit, feelings got stronger.
Now this is out of our hands, our love is here to stay.

So get used to me checking in all day.
Get used to me falling through just to see your face.
There ain't a moment I won't need your brace.
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you.
Oh get used to it, hey.
Oh get used to it, hey.
Oh get used to it, oh it.
Oh used to me holding you, used to me wowing you, oh get used to it.

And now my April shower you, forever and for me
'Til your flowers bloom in June.
Make sure that our fireworks be your fourth of July for life.
As long as you stand right by my side.
Keep growing closer throughout October.
Ooh counting down, it's almost Christmas eve.
Oh seven days shy of a New Year's eve.
Then we'll be celebrating.

So get used to me checking in all day.

Get used to it.

Feeling the remnants, caught in an instance.
Blink of an eye, no goodbye.
I had a notion, deep as the ocean.
Blue like the sky, oh my.

Like a permanent stain.
Wishing I could've just wash away, away.
Prayed our love wasn't vain.
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?

If I would've known, if I would've known.
If I would have known it could have been you.
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new.
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your enemy.
No, but if I, if I would've known.
If I would have known it could have been you, been you.

The repercussions, I'm missing your loving.
Haunts me tonight, the ghosts are alive.
All of the memories.
Of serenity.
Dwindle in my mind.
All the time.

Like a permanent stain.
Wishing I could've just wash away, away.
Prayed our love wasn't vain.
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?

If I would've known, if I would've known.
If I would have known it could have been you.
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new.
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your enemy.
No, but if I, if I would've known.
If I would have known it could have been you, been you.

If I would've known, if I would've known.
If I would have known it could have been you.
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new.
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your enemy.
No, but if I, if I would've known.
If I would have known it could have been you, been you.

Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath.
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps.
Look at all of these tears I've wept.
Look at all the promises that I've kept.

I put my heart into your hands.
Here's my soul to keep.
I let you in with all that I can.
You're not hard to reach.
And you bless me with the best gift.
That I've ever known.
You give me purpose.
Yeah, you've given me purpose.

Thinking my journey's come to an end.
Sending out a farewell to my friends, forever peace.
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease.

I put my heart into your hands.
Learn the lessons you teach.
No matter when, wherever I am.
You're not hard to reach.
And you've given me the best gift.
That I've ever known.
You give me purpose everyday.
You give me purpose in every way.

Oh, you are my everything.
Oh, you are my everything.

I don't know if this is wrong because someone else is telling me that it's wrong but I feel this so let me just like, try my best not to let this happen again. We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions.

You can't be hard on yourself for these were the cards that you were given so you have to understand that these, like... that's not who you are. You're trying to be the best you can be but that's all you can do. If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself. Give it all you got, but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening.

That's what it's....that's what's happening with me. It's like God I'm giving it all I got, sometimes I'm weak and I'm gonna do it, and it's like I'm not giving myself grace, I'm just like understanding, that's just how it is.

What about the children?
Look at all the children we can change.
What about a vision?
Be a visionary for a change.
We're the generation.
Who's gonna be the one to fight for it?
We're the inspiration.
Do you believe enough to die for it?

Who's got the heart? Who's got it?
Whose heart is the biggest?
Wear it on your sleeve.
That we can make a difference.

Ended up on a crossroad.
Try to figure out which way to go.
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill.
Running in the same place.
You got your hazard lights on now.
Hoping that somebody would slow down.
Praying for a miracle.
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas.
With a long journey ahead.
Seen a truck pull over.
God sent an angel to help you out.
He gave you direction.
Showed you how to read a map.
For that long journey ahead.
Said it ain't never over.
Oh, even in the midst of doubt.

Life is worth living, ou ou ou ou.
Life is worth living, so live another day.
The meaning of forgiveness.
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in.
Life is worth living again.

Relationship on a ski slope.
Avalanche comin' down slow.
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April.
Cause my heart is just that cold.
Skating on thin ice.
But it's strong enough to hold us up.
Seen her scream and holler.
Put us both on blast.
Tearing each other down.
When I thought it was over.
God sent an angel to help us out, yeah.
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last.
For that long journey ahead.
Said it ain't ever over.
No, even in the midst of doubt.

Life is worth living, ou ou ou ou.
Life is worth living, so live another day.
The meaning of forgiveness.
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in.
Life is worth living again, oh whoa oh.
Life is worth living again.

What I'd give for my reflection.
Is a different perception.
From what the world may see.
They try to crucify me.
I ain't perfect, won't deny.
My reputation's on the line.
So I'm working on a better me.

Life is worth living, oh yeah.
Life is worth living, so live another day.
The meaning of forgiveness.
People make mistakes.
Only God can judge me.
Life is worth living again.
Another day.
Life is worth living again.

You are to me.
A part of me just like anatomy.
You're pulling me.
You're pulling me in like you're gravity.

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful.
Instead of hollow.
Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill.
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow.

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth.
Sometimes the heart is deceiving.
Can't get out of my head, and I need you to save me.
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy.
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

You give to me.
Everything, anything that I could dream.
And at least that's what it seems.
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful.
Instead of hollow.
Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill.
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow.

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth.
Sometimes the heart is deceiving.
Can't get out of my head, and I need you to save me.
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy.
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

I'm sinking faster and faster.
Between heaven and disaster.
Sorry if I made you feel like.
I'm standing on the borderline.

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth.
Sometimes the heart is deceiving.
Can't get out of my head, and I need you to save me.
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy.
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

Yeah, yeah.
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.

(Alright)
The sun don't set the same as you're watching it go down with me.
There won't sleep the same unless you're waking up in here with me.
Oh, my heart's a vacant house when you're gone away, it's so empty.
And love don't make no sense when it's empty (Oh no)
I've driven almost every car.
It ain't the same when I'm without you, boo.
Been around a million stars.
None of them shine brighter than you.
The sky be so dark now without you.
Yeah, ooh, baby.

It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.
Oh been around the world ain't the same without you.
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.

Focus ain't the same if the picture ain't got you in it.
And every limelight.
Emotions ain't the same if it ain't about you, I don't get it.
Ever since the beginning now.
You had that effect on me.
All I wanna do is you, oh.
I mean that so literally.
Don't nobody go higher than you.
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah.

It don't make sense, no.
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.
Cause I'm doing it with you baby.
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.
I only want to hear your voice, yeah.
Oh, been around the world, ain't the same without you.
Had to find out the hard way.
It don't make sense, no.
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.
(Going way up, way up).
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.
(Way up, way up, way up).
(Yeah, slow down stay up, stay up, stay up).
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.

Time and time again I break a plan.
Without you girl I ain't the man.
Could never be all I could be.
You overstand, I'm incomplete.
Apparently, you gotta know I hate that.
How am I supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that.
Gotta be laying in that.
Rolled up, put a flame to that.
Couple times you would made it back, be patient.
Won't you pull up to me now, live forever young.
It's amazing.
I don't want to sleep unless you at home.

It don't make sense, no.
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.
No, It don't make sense.
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.
No, it don't make sense, it don't make sense.
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.
(Alright, yeah, alright) .
