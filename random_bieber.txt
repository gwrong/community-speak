 I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it.  Oh get used to it.  I got money in my hands that I'd really like to blow.  Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness.  All in it, all in it.  What do you mean?  When you broke down, I didn't leave you.  What do you mean?  Hurts but it's necessary.  They see what we got and you know they want it.  Like I want the best for us.
 If I was your boyfriend.  With a long journey ahead.  How am I supposed to take that?  Well giving up is immature.  Cause I take you home, home, home, home, home to mama.  Is a different perception.  Now I'm all gone ( gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone ... ).  I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it.  People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in.  Wishing I could've just wash away, away.  Oh get used to me loving you.  Cause I just need one more shot at second chances.  The sky be so dark now without you.
 And love don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you baby.  And every limelight.  Then we gotta learn to trust me right now.  Angry at all of these tears I've wept.  It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.  We're the generation.  Then we gotta learn to trust right now.  What do you mean?  We should be closer together, warm oceans, better weather.  In love with you, am I in love with you?  If I was your boyfriend.  You had that effect on me.  It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.  Don't want us to lose what we are.
 Cause I just need one more shot at second chances.  What do you mean?  Then we can be in love somehow.  If only I could hit the ground.  Reach for the stars now.  If you want the best for us.  Get used to me wowing you, oh.  So where are you now that I need you?
 And nobody came between us or could ever come above.  I never thought I'd be this far from home.  And we both adore one another.  I ain't goin nowhere, I ain't going nowhere.  Forget about the world, we're set in stone.  So they can't help but to come and hate on it.  Had to find out the hard way.  Twenty for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication.  Yeah, sometimes the heart can see what's invisible to the eye.  When you broke down, I didn't leave you.  Lose what we are.
 I never wanted to be your enemy.  There ain't a moment I won't need your brace.  Because I, I just didn't think I wasn't good enough.  Do you believe enough to die for it?  I thought you'd always be mine ( mine ).
 You are to me.  Can't deny it.  Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill.  Oh, my heart's a vacant house when you're gone away, it's so empty.  I close my eyes, I take it slow.  Don't want for us to end, where do I start?
 Because I, I just didn't think I wasn't good enough.  Can't get out of my head, and I need you?  Wishing I could've just wash away, away.  If only I could hit the ground.  Put your faith in me.  Oh, oh, what do you mean?  Who's got the heart?  You're a dream come true.  I'll buy you any ring.  Couple times you would made it back, be patient.
 I need you ( the ) I need you the most.  Hurts but it's necessary.  Like baby, baby oooh.  It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.  No, even in the midst of doubt.  Then we can be in love somehow.
 Said it ain't ever over.  Hurts but it's necessary.  It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.  Don't know if you're happy or complaining.  It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.  That we can make a difference.  I never wanted to be, wanted to be, wanted to be your enemy.  And by once or twice I Mean.  Wanna argue all day, make love all night.  Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill.  Yeah, yeah.  No, but if I, if I had the chance, if I would've known.
