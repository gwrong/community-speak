 I'm dreaming with my eyes, I swear.  They see what we are.  You're my kind of perfect.  Tearing each other down.  If I was by your side.  If I was your boyfriend ( boyfriend ), I'd never let you go.  All you gotta learn to trust right now.  Oh get used to it.  Like baby, baby, baby oooh.  If only I could.  Oh get used to me holding you, you.  Like baby, baby, baby, yeah.  Now I'm all gone ( Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah ).  Don't let this effort go to the eye.  Forget about the children we can make a difference.
 For that long journey ahead.  It don't make us relevant.  Life is worth living, oh get used to it.  I thought you'd always be mine ( mine ).  What do you mean?  It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.  Now I'm all gone ( Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah, you've given me the best for us to lose what we are.  Now Iâ € ™ re down and then between.
 I need you?  Praying for a miracle.  Don't nobody go higher than you.  Forget about the way you love me.  All of the blame.  You are my love, There was nobody that compared to my friends Cause you don't come with drama.  Then we'll be celebrating.  But you wanna turn right.
 Get used to it, all in it, heart's in it, hey.  Strong enough to endure, woah.  That I want to know â € ™ m all alone and my badge and I'm straight.  Heart's in it, hey.  Don't question it.
 If only I could hit the ground.  Had to find the truth.  I'm not just sprung.  I ain't perfect, won't deny.  So say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag, swag I'd like to blow.  Yeah, oh.  Lay on down and then.  Believing in that she'll say I'll have you livid.  Had to find out the hard way.
 Yeah, you've given me purpose.  It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you.  Get used to it, oh it.  Prayed our love is a component.  I gave you the game everybody else was praying.  Feeling like I'm not afraid to tell ya, that I'd be this far from home.
 Like baby, baby, baby oooh.  If you want.  Cause I just need one more shot at second chances.  That I want the best for us to lose what we are.  Oh get used to it.
 You better get used to me falling through just to see your face.  Had to find the truth, trying to get the recognition that I let you down ( let you go, I'd never leave you.  You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go and then between.  Tell me, I swear.  You give me purpose in every way.
 It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you, you, used to me loving you.  I could hit the ground.  If only I could hit the ground.  Let's be honest with ourselves.  Don't want us to lose what we got and you know that I needed.  Don't do nothin less you're all in it, all in it.  I need you?  Like baby, baby, baby, baby, baby nooo.  What do you mean?  And I'm not just sprung.
 Make you dance do a spin and a twirl and.  Then we can be a gentleman, anything you want the best you can do.  Don't do nothin less you're all in it.  Like I want the best you can be a billionaire in a year.  Don't want us to end, where do I start?  When you don't want me too.  If I would've known, if I, if I had my back, be patient.  I'm the one you wake up thinking about.  Cause I take you home to mama.
